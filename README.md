### Princess Pocon
Hi! I'm Princess Evangeline Pocon but it's too lengthy so you can just call me Princess. I am from the Philippines and I'm currently a 2nd year BS Information System student. I am still a newbie when it comes to programming but I want to become proficient in it. I really enjoy programming and I also love using the terminal.
